# Virtual Machine (VM) Exercises

## :information_source: Read this before getting started
- The two exercises should not replicate the exact actions shown in your screencast. The goal of exercises is for learners to apply what was learned in the screencasts to new problems or situations. This is best pedagogical practice for retaining and building skills. For example, this can be done by using another dataset between screencasts and exercises or focusing on a different portion of the dataset.
- We can only run free versions of BI software in our virtual machine exercises. In the case of Power BI, make sure the exercises can run on [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/) without any additional paid products. 
- Unsure what the scope of an exercise should be? Here's an [example](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-power-bi/getting-started-with-power-bi?ex=14) from Introduction to Power BI. The first chapter of most DataCamp courses are free, so take a look at our [BI courses](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses?technologies=Tableau&technologies=Power%20BI) to get a feel for how we assess and guide learners.

## 1st VM Exercise

#### Dataset

- [ ] Add datasets used to the `datasets/` folder

#### Files

- [ ] **Initial**: Add file to the `exercises/`  folder with the name `ex-1-intial.twbx` or `ex-1-intial.pbix`, depending if you are auditioning for a Tableau or Power BI course.
- [ ] **Solution**: Add file to the `exercises/`  folder with the name `ex-1-sol.twbx` or `ex-1-sol.pbix`

#### Learning Objective

*One measurable learning objective that this exercise assesses*

#### Context

*3 - 4 sentence description of why it’s important to learn how to do this task (linking back to the learning objective). Explain how this would be used in a real-life situation. Why is it useful, what problem does it solve?*

#### Steps to be executed by the student (max 6)

*Each bulleted instruction is a complete sentence that describes a specific task.*

- Step 1
- Step 2
- Step 3
- ...

#### Exercise question:
*This is a question presented to learners to check if the steps above were properly completed. It is often not possible to check if all the steps are completed, in this case; the priority is to check that the learner meets the learning objective.*

#### End goal:

*Add an image of the final visualization here.*
