# sme-bi-course-application
For this stage of the application, we will ask you to create a screencast and two corresponding virtual machine exercises for a specific portion of your course outline. 

### Getting Started 

To begin the audition portion, **fork** this repo so that a copy of this repo lives on your GitHub account.

Once you have completed the following steps, notify Instructor Success with the link to your forked copy. Make sure that we will be able to view the repo using appropriate access settings.

### Step 1: Screencast

Screencasts are used in business intelligence (BI) courses to demonstrate to learners how to achieve tasks on the user interface of the BI tool. They are essentially short tutorials (2-4 mins) for the exercises that follow. You can assume the learner is already familiar with the conceptual knowledge required for the learning objective. For example, if you are showing learners how to create a set on Tableau, you can assume they understand that sets are *custom fields that define a subset of data based on some conditions*. 

 Here are examples of screencasts: [Working with containers](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/creating-dashboards-in-tableau/getting-started-with-dashboards?ex=12),  [Slicers and Tables](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-power-bi/getting-started-with-power-bi?ex=7), and [Customer activity in motion](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/analyzing-data-in-tableau/mapping-analysis?ex=2). 
 
 *Tips for recording the screencast: make sure the audio narration is clear and not too fast to follow. It’s often easier to first record the audio and then record your screen while listening to the audio.* 

- [ ] Upload your screencast to your platform of choice (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive) and paste the link here: 

### Step 2: Virtual Machine Exercises

A virtual machine (VM) exercise requires learners to complete 3 - 6 actions in a Tableau Workbook or Power BI Report. The two VM exercises that follow a demo screencast should cover software-related skills that are covered in the screencast. A virtual machine exercise consists of:

- The measurable **learning objective** that this exercise assesses
- A **context** that engages the learner and explains why they are doing this exercise.
- 3 - 6 bulleted **instructions**
- A **question** that assesses whether the instructions were properly followed.
- Two workbook or report files:
  - The **initial file**: what the learner will begin with
  - The **solution file**: what a correct solution would look like after completing the instruction

In our [Power BI and Tableau courses](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses?technologies=Tableau&technologies=Power%20BI), you will be able to find a many virtual machine exercises that test a variety of skills.

To create your two VM exercises, complete the template `vm-exercises.md`.
